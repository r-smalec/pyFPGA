# pyFPGA
Python scripts for automatization of tasks while FPGA design in Verilog and VHDL.

Easy to use: copy your code -> run script -> paste prepared code to your project

Requirements:
* python installed
* pyperclip module installed

## Each script has example usecase in its source code!
Scripts ready to use:
* pyFPGA_module_init.py  for Verilog modules initialization
* pyFPGA_signals_declaration.py  for Verilog signals declaration
* pyFPGA_diff_signals_into_bufds.py  for Verilog differential signals pack into IBUFFDS for input and OBUFDS for output
* pyFPGA_testbench_generator for unit test of a single Verilog module

Work in progress:

Planed for the future:
* case instruction generator
* module initializator with parameters interpretation
